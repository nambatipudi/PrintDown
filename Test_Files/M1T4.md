# Grade 6 Workbook — Decimals

## Section 1. What are decimals?

### 1.1 Decimals as numbers

A **decimal** is another way to show parts of a whole, using a system based on 10s. For example, 0.3 means “three tenths,” or 3 out of 10 equal parts. 
Decimals can be placed on a number line, just like whole numbers and fractions. There are an *infinite* number of decimals between any two decimals — you can always zoom in and find more values in between. 

### 1.2 Comparing decimals

To compare two decimals, you look place value by place value: tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc. You can also compare them on a number line to see which is to the right (bigger) and which is to the left (smaller). 

Example: Which is greater, 1/2 or 0.35?

* First write 1/2 as a decimal.
  1/2 = 0.5
* On a number line, 0.5 is to the right of 0.35.
  So 1/2 > 0.35. 

### 1.3 Place value reminder

* Tenths = first place after the decimal (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, …)
* Hundredths = second place after the decimal (0.01, 0.02, 0.03, …)
* Thousandths = third place after the decimal (0.001, …)

### Quick Check (Section 1)

1. Which is greater: 0.4 or 0.39?
2. Put these in order from least to greatest: 0.72, 0.702, 0.8
3. Which is larger: 3/10 or 0.25?
4. Which is farther to the right on a number line: 0.5 or 0.47?
5. True or False: There are only 9 decimals between 0.3 and 0.4.

---

## Section 2. Adding and Subtracting Decimals

### 2.1 Lining up the decimals

When you add or subtract decimals, you **must line up the decimal points** so the digits in the same place value are in the same column. This lets you add tenths to tenths, hundredths to hundredths, etc. 

Example (addition):
3.421 + 9.5 + 12.85
Step 1: Line up the decimal points in a column.
Step 2: Add like normal.
Answer: 25.771
Before you even calculate, you can estimate (3 + 10 + 13 ≈ 26) to check that 25.771 makes sense. 

Example (subtraction):
18.205 − 3.91
Line up the decimals and subtract.
The exact answer is 14.295.
A quick estimate first (18 − 4 ≈ 14) tells you the answer is reasonable. 

You can do the same idea with other problems like 22.4 − 8.936, and again compare the final answer to your estimate to see if it’s “in the ballpark.” 

### 2.2 Why estimate first?

Estimation gives you a “target zone.” If your final answer is way off from your estimate, you know to re-check.

---

### Quick Check (Section 2)

Add or subtract. Show your work with decimals lined up.

1. 4.8 + 0.62 = ______
2. 12.03 + 7.9 = ______
3. 18.205 − 3.91 = ______
4. 22.4 − 8.936 = ______
5. Estimate 3.421 + 9.5 + 12.85 in your head first. Then give the exact sum.

---

## Section 3. Multiplying Decimals

### 3.1 How to multiply decimals

Step 1: Multiply the numbers like they’re whole numbers.
Step 2: Count how many total decimal places are in the factors.
Step 3: Put that many decimal places in the product.

Example: 32.64 × 7.3

* 32.64 has 2 decimal places
* 7.3 has 1 decimal place
  Total = 3 decimal places
  When you multiply 3264 × 73 (ignore decimals at first), you get 238272. Now place the decimal so the answer has 3 decimal places: 238.272. 

This is the standard multiplication algorithm for decimals — same idea as whole numbers, plus careful decimal placement. 

---

### Quick Check (Section 3)

Multiply. Show how many decimal places you counted.

1. 4.2 × 0.6 = ______
2. 0.35 × 0.5 = ______
3. 12.4 × 3 = ______
4. 5.08 × 1.2 = ______
5. 32.64 × 7.3 = ______

---

### Extra vocab from this lesson:

Even though Topic 4 is about decimals, you’ll also see some geometry words here:

* A **kite** is a quadrilateral (4-sided shape) with two pairs of consecutive sides that are congruent (the two sides in each pair are the same length, and each pair touches). 
* A **composite solid** is a 3D shape made by combining more than one simpler solid. For example, a shape that looks like “a cylinder stuck on top of a rectangular prism” is a composite solid. 

Write these in your math notebook. You’ll see them again.

---

## Section 4. Dividing Decimals (Long Division)

### 4.1 Long division with decimals

The standard long division algorithm works with decimals the same way it does with whole numbers — you’re asking “How many times does the divisor fit into the dividend?” and you bring down digits place by place. 

Example: 3.57 ÷ 3

* Divide 3 ones by 3 → that’s 1, remainder 0
* Divide 5 tenths by 3 → that’s 1 tenth each, remainder 2 tenths
* Now you’re really dividing 27 hundredths by 3 → that’s 9 hundredths each
  So 3.57 ÷ 3 = 1.19.  

You keep track of tenths, hundredths, etc. using place value. That’s why lining things up in columns is important.

### 4.2 Dividing when the divisor is NOT a whole number

If you’re dividing a decimal by another decimal, you can “move the decimal” in both numbers the same amount until the divisor becomes a whole number. This does NOT change the quotient.

For example: 7.56 ÷ 3.6
Multiply both numbers by 10:
7.56 × 10 = 75.6
3.6 × 10 = 36
Now solve 75.6 ÷ 36 instead. Same final answer, just easier to divide because the divisor (36) is a whole number. 

This works because multiplying both numbers by the same power of 10 keeps the value of the quotient the same. (It’s like scaling both by 10, 100, etc.) 

---

### Quick Check (Section 4)

1. 3.57 ÷ 3 = ______
2. 9.6 ÷ 3 = ______
3. Rewrite 8.4 ÷ 0.7 as a whole-number division problem (what do you multiply both numbers by?). Then solve.
4. 7.56 ÷ 3.6 = ______
5. Explain why it’s okay to multiply both the dividend and divisor by 10 in problem #4.

---

## Section 5. Fractions ↔ Decimals

(terminating vs repeating)

### 5.1 Fractions are division

A fraction bar means division.

* 3/8 means “3 ÷ 8.”
* 2/3 means “2 ÷ 3.” 

If you actually DO the division using long division:

* 3 ÷ 8 = 0.375
  This decimal ends. That’s called a **terminating decimal** because it has digits that stop. 
* 2 ÷ 3 = 0.666…
  The 6 keeps repeating forever. That’s called a **repeating decimal** because a pattern of digits keeps going and going with no end. You can write it with a bar: 0.6̅.  

### 5.2 Vocabulary

* **Terminating decimal:** has a limited number of digits after the decimal point (it eventually stops or turns into all zeros like 0.5000…). 
* **Repeating decimal:** has a digit or group of digits that repeat forever, like 0.333… or 2.848484… You can draw a bar over the repeating part. 

---

### Quick Check (Section 5)

1. Turn 3/8 into a decimal. Is it terminating or repeating?
2. Turn 2/3 into a decimal. Is it terminating or repeating?
3. Which is bigger: 0.66… or 2/3? (Careful: is 0.66… exactly the same as 2/3?)
4. True or False: Every fraction turns into a decimal that ends.
5. What does the fraction bar mean in 5/4?
