# Grade 6 Workbook — Shapes and Solids

## Section 1. Triangles: Can you build it? What are the angles?

### 1.1 Congruent triangles and “unique triangle”

Two triangles are **congruent** when all their matching sides are the same length **and** all their matching angles have the same measure. If that is true, they are basically the same triangle (same size and same shape).

Sometimes, the information you’re given (like certain sides and angles) is enough to force only one possible triangle. Then we say that information defines a **unique triangle**.

Other times, you can make more than one different triangle using the same info.

---

### 1.2 Triangle Inequality Theorem

The **Triangle Inequality Theorem** says:

> In any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be **greater** than the length of the third side.

If the triangle has sides $AB$, $BC$, and $AC$, then all of these must be true:

* $AB + BC > AC$
* $BC + AC > AB$
* $AB + AC > BC$

If any one of those fails, you **cannot** build a triangle with those side lengths.

**Important:**

* If you’re only given 2 sides, you can draw infinitely many different triangles (you can “swing” the 3rd side around like a hinge).
* If you’re given 3 specific side lengths, either  
  - you get exactly one triangle (a unique triangle), or  
  - you get **no** triangle at all (if the lengths break Triangle Inequality).

---

### 1.3 Triangle Sum Theorem

The **Triangle Sum Theorem** says:

> The measures of the 3 interior angles of any triangle always add up to $180^\circ$.

Example:  
If the first two angles are $22^\circ$ and $104^\circ$, then

[
$22^\circ + 104^\circ + x^\circ = 180^\circ$  
$126^\circ + x^\circ = 180^\circ$  
$x^\circ = 54^\circ$
]

So the third angle is $54^\circ$.

---

### 1.4 Longest side ↔ Biggest angle

In a triangle:

* The **longest side** is always across from (opposite) the **largest angle**.
* The **shortest side** is opposite the **smallest angle**.

So, if you know which angle is largest, you also know which side is longest.

---

### Quick Check (Section 1)

1. Can these side lengths make a triangle: 4 cm, 5 cm, 10 cm?  
   (Hint: check $4 + 5 > 10$.)

2. Can these side lengths make a triangle: 6 cm, 7 cm, 8 cm?  
   (Check all three inequalities.)

3. A triangle has angles $22^\circ$ and $104^\circ$.  
   What is the missing angle?

4. In $\triangle RST$:
   * $\angle R = 100^\circ$  
   * $\angle S = 50^\circ$  
   * $\angle T = 30^\circ$  
   Which side is longest: $RS$, $ST$, or $TR$?  
   Explain using “biggest angle ↔ longest side.”

5. True or False:  
   If two triangles have all corresponding sides the same length **and** all corresponding angles the same measure, then they are congruent.

## Section 2. Area of Parallelograms, Triangles, and Trapezoids

You already know area of rectangles. Now we stretch that thinking to new shapes. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

---

### 2.1 Parallelogram

A **parallelogram** is a 4-sided figure (a quadrilateral) with two pairs of parallel sides. Each pair of opposite sides is equal in length.

* The **base** $b$ is one side you choose to measure along the bottom.
* The **height** $h$ is the perpendicular distance from that base to the opposite side  
  (not the slanted side length!).

The **area** formula for a parallelogram is:

[
$ \text{Area} = b \times h $
]

Example:  
If $b = 20 \text{ ft}$ and $h = 12 \text{ ft}$, then

[
$ \text{Area} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet} $
]

---

### 2.2 Triangle

For **any** triangle:

* You can choose any side to be the **base** $b$.
* The **height** $h$ is drawn from the opposite vertex straight to that base so it makes a right angle (perpendicular).

The **area** formula for a triangle is:

[
$ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} b h $
]

This is the same as saying $\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h$.

Example:  
If $b = 2 \text{ yards}$ and $h = 1.5 \text{ yards}$, then

[
$ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 1.5 = 1.5 \text{ square yards} $
]

---

### 2.3 Trapezoid

A **trapezoid** is a quadrilateral with exactly two parallel sides. Those two parallel sides are the **bases**, usually written $b_1$ and $b_2$.

The **height** $h$ is the perpendicular distance between those two bases (straight across, not slanted).

The **area** formula for a trapezoid is:

[
$ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} (b_1 + b_2) h $
]

Example:  
If $b_1 = 8 \text{ m}$, $b_2 = 12 \text{ m}$, and $h = 9 \text{ m}$:

[
$ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} (8 + 12) \times 9  
= \frac{1}{2} \times 20 \times 9  
= 90 \text{ square meters} $
]

---

### Quick Check (Section 2)

1. A parallelogram has base $15 \text{ cm}$ and height $7 \text{ cm}$.  
   $\text{Area} = \_\_\_\_$ square cm

2. A triangle has base $10 \text{ in}$ and height $4 \text{ in}$.  
   $\text{Area} = \_\_\_\_$ square in

3. A trapezoid has $b_1 = 5 \text{ m}$, $b_2 = 11 \text{ m}$, and height $6 \text{ m}$.  
   $\text{Area} = \_\_\_\_$ square m

4. In the triangle area formula  
   [
   $ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} b h $
   ]  
   which variable stands for the perpendicular height of the triangle?

5. In your own words:  
   What is the “height” of a parallelogram?

## Section 3. 3D Shapes: Faces, Edges, Vertices, and Volume

### 3.1 Vocabulary for solids

* A **polygon** is a closed 2D shape made of straight line segments.
* A **geometric solid** is a 3D shape (it takes up space).
* A **polyhedron** is a 3D solid made of flat polygon faces.
  * Each flat polygon is called a **face**.
  * The line where two faces meet is an **edge**.
  * A **vertex** is a point where edges meet.

* A **right rectangular prism** is a polyhedron with 6 rectangular faces; opposite faces are congruent and parallel. (Think: a box / brick.)
* A **cube** is a special polyhedron with 6 congruent square faces (all edges the same length).
* **Volume** is how much space a 3D object takes up. We measure it in **cubic units** (like cubic inches $\text{in}^3$ or cubic centimeters $\text{cm}^3$).
* A **unit cube** is a cube that’s $1 \times 1 \times 1$ unit in size.

---

### 3.2 Volume of a right rectangular prism

For a right rectangular prism:

* The base is a rectangle with length $l$ and width $w$.  
  The area of that base is $B = l \times w$.
* The height is $h$.

The volume is:

[
$ V = B \times h = l \times w \times h $
]

This formula still works even if $l$, $w$, and $h$ are positive rational numbers (fractions or mixed numbers). You can imagine filling the prism with tiny cubes and counting them.

Example from class:  
A prism has length $1\frac{1}{2}\text{ in}$, width $\frac{1}{2}\text{ in}$, and height $\frac{3}{4}\text{ in}$.  
You can multiply those directly:

[
$ V = \left(1\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) $  
$ = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) $  
$ = \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{4}$  
$ \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{16} \text{ in}^3 $
]

So the volume is $\frac{9}{16} \text{ in}^3$. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

# PRACTICE SET D. Volume Problems (include fractions)

1. A right rectangular prism has  
   $l = 4 \text{ cm}$, $w = 3 \text{ cm}$, $h = 2 \text{ cm}$.  
   Find the volume in cubic cm.  
   (Use $V = l \times w \times h$.)

   Multiply to find the volume as a fraction of a cubic inch.

   Hint rewrite:

## Section 1 Quick Check Answers

1. $4 + 5 = 9$, which is **not** $> 10$. So those side lengths cannot make a triangle.

2. Check:
   * $6 + 7 > 8$  
   * $7 + 8 > 6$  
   * $6 + 8 > 7$  
   All true, so **yes**, that works.

3. $22^\circ + 104^\circ = 126^\circ$.  
   $180^\circ - 126^\circ = 54^\circ$.  
   Missing angle is $54^\circ$.

4. The largest angle is $100^\circ$ at $R$.  
   The longest side is opposite that angle, which is side $ST$.

5. True.

3. Trapezoid area:  
   $\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (5 + 11) \times 6  
   = \frac{1}{2} \times 16 \times 6  
   = 48 \text{ m}^2$

4. $h$ is the perpendicular height.

5. The height of a parallelogram is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite side (not the slanted side).

   $1\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{4}$  
   $= \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{4}$  
   $\frac{3}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{4}$  
   $\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{16}$  
   Volume $= \frac{9}{16} \text{ in}^3$

---

## Practice Set A Answers

1. $5 + 7 = 12$, and $12$ is **not** $> 20$. So no triangle.

2. Check:
   * $4 + 9 > 10$  
   * $9 + 10 > 4$  
   * $4 + 10 > 9$  
   All true, so yes, triangle.

3. $40^\circ + 75^\circ = 115^\circ$  
   $180^\circ - 115^\circ = 65^\circ$  
   Third angle is $65^\circ$.

4. The longest side is opposite the largest angle.  
   Largest angle is $110^\circ$ at $A$, so $BC$ is longest.

5. Yes. They’re congruent.

6. $x + 60 + 45 = 180$  
   $x + 105 = 180$  
   $x = 75^\circ$

7. The smallest angle is opposite the shortest side.  
   If $\overline{XY}$ is shortest, then the smallest angle is $\angle Z$.

8. $90^\circ + 90^\circ + 10^\circ = 190^\circ$, not $180^\circ$. Not possible.

9. The Triangle Sum Theorem: the three interior angles of any triangle must add to $180^\circ$.

10. Yes. With only two sides fixed, you can “swing” the third side, so you can draw many different triangles.
