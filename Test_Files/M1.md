# Grade 6 – Module 1

**Composing and Decomposing: Factors, Fractions, Shapes, and Decimals**
---

## Module 1 Overview

Module 1 is about **composing and decomposing**: breaking things apart and putting them back together — numbers, shapes, areas, volumes, and even strategies. 

We study these 4 topics:

1. **Factors and Multiples:** prime factorization, GCF, LCM, Distributive Property. 
2. **Positive Rational Numbers:** multiply and divide fractions, reciprocals, and what division of fractions actually means. 
3. **Shapes and Solids:** triangle rules, area formulas, and volume of prisms (including fractional edges). 
4. **Decimals:** comparing, adding/subtracting, multiplying, dividing, and turning fractions into decimals. 

**Process skill for this module:** explain your reasoning. Draw diagrams, write equations, and check if your final answer actually makes sense. 

**Word of the Module: Analyze.** To analyze means to look for patterns, break apart a complex problem, and connect it to something you’ve already seen.

# Topic 1. Factors and Multiples

*GCF, LCM, Prime Factorization, Distributive Property*
The big idea: Numbers can be “built” from primes and “grouped” by common factors. We use that to solve problems about sharing, repeating schedules, and rewriting expressions. 

---

## 1.1 Key Ideas

### Factors / Multiples / Prime Factorization

* A **factor** of a number is a whole number that divides it with no remainder.
  Example: $3$ and $8$ are both factors of $24$ because $3 \times 8 = 24$.

* A **factor pair** is two numbers that multiply to get your number.
  For $24$: $(1,24)$, $(2,12)$, $(3,8)$, $(4,6)$.

* A **multiple** of a number is that number times $1,2,3,4,\dots$
  Multiples of $6$: $6,12,18,24,30,\dots$

* A **prime number** has exactly two factors: $1$ and itself (like $2,3,5,7,11,\dots$).

* A **composite number** has more than two factors (like $12,18,20,\dots$).

* A **prime factorization** writes a number as a product of primes.
  Example:
  [$36 = 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 = 2^2 \times 3^2$]
  [
  $30 = 2 \times 3 \times 5$ ]

We use **factor trees** to break a number down until only primes are left. 

---

### Greatest Common Factor (GCF)

The **Greatest Common Factor** of two (or more) numbers is the largest number that divides all of them with no remainder.
Example using prime factors:

* $56 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 7$
* $42 = 2 \times 3 \times 7$

Shared primes: $2$ and $7$
So
$[\text{GCF}(56,42) = 2 \times 7 = 14]$


Two numbers are **relatively prime** if their only common factor is $1$.

---

### Least Common Multiple (LCM)

The **Least Common Multiple** of two numbers is the smallest positive number that is a multiple of both.

Example:
If one bus comes every $15$ minutes and another every $9$ minutes, the first few multiples are:

* Multiples of $15$: $15,30,45,60,\dots$
* Multiples of $9$: $9,18,27,36,45,54,\dots$

They meet again at $45$. So
$[
\text{LCM}(15,9) = 45
]$

You can also get LCM using prime factors by combining all required prime powers.  

---

### Distributive Property

The Distributive Property says
$[
a(b+c)=ab+ac
]$
Example:
$[
4(2+15)=4\cdot 2+4\cdot 15=8+60=68
]$
This is helpful for mental math and breaking numbers apart.

# Topic 2. Positive Rational Numbers

*Fractions, Multiplying & Dividing Fractions, Reciprocals*
We model fractions visually, then generalize into reliable algorithms. 

---

## 2.1 Key Ideas

### Vocabulary

* **Unit fraction:** numerator $=1$, like $\frac{1}{5}$.
* **Equivalent fractions:** same amount, e.g. $\frac{1}{2}=\frac{2}{4}$.
* **Benchmark fractions:** $0,\ \frac12,\ 1$ (used to compare sizes quickly). 
* **Rational number:** any number that can be written as $\frac{a}{b}$ where $a,b$ are whole numbers and $b\neq 0$.
* **Reciprocal / multiplicative inverse:** the reciprocal of $\frac{a}{b}$ is $\frac{b}{a}$, and
  $[
  \frac{a}{b}\times\frac{b}{a}=1.
  ]$

### Comparing Fractions

Ask: Is $\frac{a}{b}$ close to $0$, close to $\frac12$, or close to $1$?

* If $a$ is tiny vs $b$, it’s near $0$.
* If $a \approx \frac{b}{2}$, it’s near $\frac12$.
* If $a$ and $b$ are almost equal, it’s near $1$. 

### Multiplying Fractions

Multiply straight across:
$[
\frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d}]$
==============================
$[
\frac{a \times c}{b \times d}
]$

Example:
$[
\frac14 \times \frac12 = \frac{1\times 1}{4\times 2} = \frac{1}{8}
]$
Area models show this as “part of a part.” 

### Dividing Fractions

“$\frac{5}{8} \div \frac{3}{4}$” means “How many $\frac{3}{4}$’s are in $\frac{5}{8}$?”
The standard algorithm is:

1. Keep the first fraction.
2. Multiply by the reciprocal of the second.
3. Simplify.

$[
\frac{5}{8} \div \frac{3}{4}]$\
\
$[\frac{5}{8} \times \frac{4}{3}]$\
\
$\frac{20}{24}$\
\
$\frac{5}{6}$



For whole $\div$ fraction, like $6\div\frac12$: “How many halves are in $6$?”
Each whole has $2$ halves, so $6$ wholes have $12$ halves:
$[
6 \div \frac12 = 12
]$

## Topic 2 — Answer Key (self-check)

**Quick Check / Practice Highlights:**

* Unit fraction: $\frac15$

* Yes, $\frac24=\frac12$

* $\frac36$ is close to $\frac12$

* Order: $\frac13 < \frac23 < \frac33$

* $\frac56 > \frac45$ (compare cross-products: $5\times5=25$, $6\times4=24$)

* $\frac14 \times \frac12 = \frac18$

* $\frac23 \times \frac35 = \frac{6}{15} = \frac25$

* $6 \div \frac12 = 12$

* $4 \div \frac23 = 6$

* $\frac58 \div \frac34 = \frac58 \times \frac43 = \frac{20}{24} = \frac56$

More results:

* $\frac56 \times \frac13=\frac{5}{18}$
* $\frac25 \times \frac25=\frac{4}{25}$
* $8 \div \frac14 = 32$
* $5 \div \frac15 = 25$
* $9 \div \frac34 = 12$
* $3 \div \frac25 = \frac{3}{1}\times\frac{5}{2}=\frac{15}{2}=7\frac12$

Mixed numbers:

* $1\frac34 = \frac74$, $2\frac12=\frac52$
  $[
  \frac74 \times \frac52 = \frac{35}{8} = 4\frac38
  ]$
* $3 \times 1\frac23 = 3 \times \frac53 = \frac{15}{3}=5$
* $4\frac12 = \frac92$, so
  $[
  \frac92 \times \frac23 = \frac{18}{6}=3
  ]$
* $2\frac12 \times 6 = \frac52 \times 6 = 15$

Dividing fractions:

* $\frac23 \div \frac45 = \frac23 \times \frac54 = \frac{10}{12} = \frac56$
* $\frac{7}{10} \div \frac12 = \frac{7}{10} \times \frac21 = \frac{14}{10} = \frac75 = 1\frac25$
* $\frac94 \div \frac32 = \frac94 \times \frac23 = \frac{18}{12} = \frac32 = 1\frac12$
* $\frac16 \div \frac{5}{12} = \frac16 \times \frac{12}{5} = \frac{12}{30} = \frac25$
* Reciprocal of $\frac34$ is $\frac43$

Why reciprocal works:
Dividing by $\frac ab$ asks “How many chunks of size $\frac ab$ fit in this?”
That’s exactly what multiplying by $\frac ba$ counts.

# Topic 3. Shapes and Solids

*Triangles, Area, Volume*
You’ll connect angle sums, side lengths, and area/volume formulas. 

---

## 3.1 Key Ideas

### Triangles

* **Triangle Inequality Theorem:**
  For any triangle with sides $a,b,c$, all of these must be true:
  $[
  a+b>c,\quad b+c>a,\quad a+c>b.
  ]$ 
  If not, that triangle can’t exist.

* **Triangle Sum Theorem:**
  The measures of the three interior angles of any triangle add to $180^\circ$.
  So if two angles are $22^\circ$ and $104^\circ$:
  $[
  22^\circ + 104^\circ + x^\circ = 180^\circ \Rightarrow x^\circ = 54^\circ.
  ]$

* **Longest side $\leftrightarrow$ Largest angle:**
  The longest side is opposite the largest angle.
  The shortest side is opposite the smallest angle.

---

### Area of Parallelograms / Triangles / Trapezoids

* **Parallelogram:**
  $[
  \text{Area} = b \times h
  ]$
  where $b$ is the chosen base and $h$ is the perpendicular height (not the slanted side).

* **Triangle:**
  $[
  \text{Area} = \frac12 b h
  ]$
  The height $h$ is drawn perpendicular to the base $b$.

* **Trapezoid:**
  A trapezoid has exactly two parallel sides (bases). Call them $b_1$ and $b_2$.
  $[
  \text{Area} = \frac12 (b_1 + b_2) h
  ]$

---

### 3D Vocabulary and Volume

* **Polyhedron:** 3D solid made of flat polygon faces.
* **Face:** one flat polygon surface of a solid.
* **Edge:** segment where two faces meet.
* **Vertex:** point where edges meet.
* **Right rectangular prism:** box with $6$ rectangular faces.
* **Cube:** prism with $6$ congruent square faces.
* **Volume:** how much space a 3D shape takes up. Measured in **cubic units** like $\text{cm}^3$ or $\text{in}^3$.
* **Unit cube:** $1 \times 1 \times 1$ cube.

For a right rectangular prism with length $\ell$, width $w$, height $h$:
$[
V = \ell \times w \times h
]$
This still works even if $\ell,w,h$ are fractions. You can think of packing it with tiny cubes.

## Topic 3 — Answer Key (self-check)

Quick highlights:

* Triangle check: $4+5=9$, which is **not** $>10$, so those sides cannot form a triangle.
* Angle sum: $22^\circ+104^\circ=126^\circ$, so missing angle is $54^\circ$.
* Longest side is opposite the largest angle.
* Parallelogram area: $A=bh$.
* Triangle area: $A=\frac12 bh$.
* Trapezoid area: $A=\frac12(b_1+b_2)h$.
* Prism volume: $V=\ell \times w \times h$.
  Even with fractional edges like $\frac32,\ \frac12,\ \frac34$, you multiply:\
  $[
  \frac32 \times \frac12 = \frac{3}{4}, \quad
  \frac{3}{4} \times \frac34 = \frac{9}{16}\text{ in}^3
  ]$

# Topic 4. Decimals

*Compare, Add/Subtract, Multiply, Divide, and Fractions → Decimals*
You connect fractions and decimals, and you get really good at decimal operations. 

---

## 4.1 Key Ideas

### Decimals and Place Value

A decimal shows parts of a whole using tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc.
Example: $0.5$ means $\frac{5}{10}$, and $0.35$ means $\frac{35}{100}$.

On a number line, the number farther to the right is greater.
Since $\frac12 = 0.5$, and $0.5$ is to the right of $0.35$, we know $\frac12 > 0.35$. 

Between any two decimals, there are infinitely many more decimals. (You can always zoom in.) 

---

### Adding and Subtracting Decimals

Rule:

1. Line up the decimal points.
2. Add/subtract like normal.
3. Check with an estimate.

Example:
[
18.205 - 3.91 = 14.295
]
Estimate first: $18-4 \approx 14$ so $14.295$ makes sense. 

---

### Multiplying Decimals

Steps:

1. Ignore the decimals and multiply as whole numbers.
2. Count total decimal places in both factors.
3. Place the decimal in the product so it has that many places.

Example:\
$[
32.64 \times 7.3 = 238.272
]$\
Reason: $32.64$ has $2$ decimal places, $7.3$ has $1$, so the product must have $3$ total. 

---

### Dividing Decimals

We can use long division with decimals by thinking in place value chunks.\
Example:\
$[
3.57 \div 3 = 1.19
]$\
You are basically asking, “How many $3$’s fit into $3.57$?” and working digit by digit. 

When dividing by a decimal, scale both numbers by the same power of $10$ until the divisor is a whole number.

Example:\
$[
7.56 \div 3.6
]$\
Multiply both numbers by $10$:
$[
7.56 \times 10 = 75.6,\quad 3.6 \times 10 = 36
]$\
So the problem becomes
$[
75.6 \div 36 = 2.1
]$\
Same answer, easier division. 

This works because multiplying both dividend and divisor by the same power of $10$ keeps the ratio the same.

---

### Fractions as Decimals

A fraction bar means division:\
$[
\frac{3}{8} = 3 \div 8 = 0.375
\quad \text{(terminating decimal)}
]$\
$[
\frac{2}{3} = 2 \div 3 = 0.6666\ldots
\quad \text{(repeating decimal, often written }0.\overline{6}\text{)}
]$\
A **terminating decimal** stops.
A **repeating decimal** has a digit or block of digits that repeats forever. 

Also in Topic 4 you meet:

* a **kite** (a quadrilateral with two pairs of equal-length sides next to each other), and
* a **composite solid** (a 3D shape made of more than one simpler solid).

## Topic 4 — Answer Key (self-check)

**Comparing decimals:**

* $0.4 > 0.39$
* Least $\to$ greatest: $0.702,\ 0.72,\ 0.8$
* $\frac{3}{10}=0.3$ so $0.3>0.25$
* $0.5$ is to the right of $0.47$ on the number line
* There are infinitely many decimals between two decimals (so “only 9” is False). 

**Add/Subtract:**\
$[
4.8+0.62=5.42
]$\
$[
12.03+7.9=19.93
]$\
$[
18.205-3.91=14.295
]$\
$[
22.4-8.936=13.464
]$\
$[
3.421+9.5+12.85=25.771
]$\
Estimation check: $3+10+13\approx26$, close to $25.771$. 

**Multiply:**\
$[
4.2\times0.6=2.52
]$\
$[
0.35\times0.5=0.175
]$\
$[
12.4\times3=37.2
]$\
$[
5.08\times1.2=6.096
]$\
$[
32.64\times7.3=238.272
]$\
We place the decimal so that the number of total decimal places in the product equals the total from the two factors. 

**Divide:**\
$[
3.57 \div 3 = 1.19
]
[
7.56 \div 3.6 = 2.1 \quad\text{because }7.56\div3.6 = 75.6\div36
]$
Multiplying both numbers by the same power of $10$ doesn’t change the quotient; it just makes the divisor a whole number that’s easier to divide. 

**Fractions $\to$ decimals:**\
$[
\frac38 = 0.375 \quad\text{(terminating)}
]$\
$[
\frac23 = 0.\overline{6} \quad\text{(repeating)}
]$\
Not all fractions terminate — some repeat forever. 

**Word problems (summary answers):**

* Distance: $2.4+1.35+0.8=4.55\text{ km}$
* Money left: $18.20 − $3.91 = $14.29
* Rope pieces: $7.56\div3.6=2.1$ pieces
* Notebooks: $4.25\times7=$29.75$
* Split money: $12.50 ÷ 5 = $2.50 each
* Rod pieces: $0.75\div0.25=3$
* Product reasonableness: $32.64\approx33$, $7.3\approx7$, $33\times7\approx231$, which is close to $238.272$, and the decimal-place rule matches
* Wood total: $1.02+0.95+0.7=2.67\text{ m}$
* Tank: $75.6\div3.6=2.1$ containers
* Gum: $3 \times $1.19 = $3.57$, same as $3.57
