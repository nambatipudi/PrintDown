# Grade 6 Warm-Up Pack  
## Section 1. Factors, Multiples, and Prime Factorization
* A **factor** of a number is a whole number that multiplies with another whole number to make that number.

  Example: $3$ and $8$ are factors of $24$ because  
  [
  $ 3 \times 8 = 24 $
  ]

* A **factor pair** is two numbers you multiply to get your number.

  For $24$, the factor pairs are  
  $(1, 24)$, $(2, 12)$, $(3, 8)$, $(4, 6)$.

* A **multiple** of a number is what you get when you multiply that number by $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \dots$

  Example: Multiples of $6$ are  
  $6,\ 12,\ 18,\ 24,\ 30,\ \dots$

* **Prime factorization** means: break a number into only prime numbers multiplied together.

  Example:  
  [
  $ 30 = 2 \times 3 \times 5 $
  ]

  Example:  
  [
  $ 24 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 = 2^3 \times 3 $
  ]

* A **prime** number has exactly two factors: $1$ and itself  
  (like $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, \dots$).

* A **composite** number has more than two factors  
  (like $12, 18, 20, \dots$).

---

### Quick Check (Section 1)

1. List all factor pairs of $20$.

2. Circle the prime numbers:  
   $21,\ 17,\ 12,\ 19,\ 25,\ 29$

3. Write the prime factorization of $36$ using exponents.

4. List the first $5$ multiples of $7$.

---

## Section 2. Greatest Common Factor (GCF)

The **Greatest Common Factor (GCF)** of two or more numbers is the biggest number that divides all of them with no remainder.

We write GCF like this:  
[
$ \text{GCF}(a,b) $
]

**Why do we care?**  
We use GCF to split things into equal groups with nothing left over.

**Example:**  
We want to pack $24$ red pens and $16$ blue pens into gift bags so that every bag is EXACTLY the same and we use all the pens.  
How many bags can we make?

1. First find  
   [
   $ \text{GCF}(24,16) = 8 $
   ]

2. That means we can make $8$ identical bags.

3. Each bag gets  
   $24 \div 8 = 3$ red pens and  
   $16 \div 8 = 2$ blue pens.

**Relatively prime:**  
Two numbers are called **relatively prime** if their only common factor is $1$.

Example: $8$ and $15$ are relatively prime because they don’t share any factor bigger than $1$.

---

### Quick Check (Section 2)

1. Find $ \text{GCF}(18,24) $.

2. Are $9$ and $28$ relatively prime? (Yes or No)

3. You have $30$ stickers and $45$ erasers. You want identical prize packs with no leftovers.  
   What’s the greatest number of packs you can make?  
   (Hint: use $ \text{GCF}(30,45) $.)

---

## Section 3. Least Common Multiple (LCM)

The **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of two numbers is the smallest positive number that is a multiple of BOTH numbers.  
We write it like this:

[
$ \text{LCM}(a,b) $
]

**Why do we care?**  
LCM tells us when two repeating events will match up again.

**Example:**  
A local bus comes every $15$ minutes.  
An express bus comes every $9$ minutes.  
They both show up at 10:00 AM.  
When will they both show up together again?

[
$ \text{LCM}(15,9) = 45 $
]

So they will both come again in $45$ minutes → at 10:45 AM.

---

### Quick Check (Section 3)

1. Find $ \text{LCM}(6,8) $.

2. Kayla does jumping jacks every $4$ days and sit-ups every $6$ days.  
   Today she does both.  
   In how many days will she do both on the same day again?  
   (Hint: $ \text{LCM}(4,6) $.)

---

## Section 4. Distributive Property

The **Distributive Property** says:

[
$ a \times (b + c) = a \times b + a \times c $
]

**Example:**

[
$ 4 \times (2 + 15)  
= 4 \times 2 + 4 \times 15  
= 8 + 60  
= 68 $
]

Why is this cool?  
It lets you break numbers apart to do mental math faster.

---

### Quick Check (Section 4)

Rewrite using the Distributive Property and then solve:

1. $6 \times (20 + 7) = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_$

2. $9 \times (10 + 4) = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_$

3. $12 \times (30 + 5) = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_$
