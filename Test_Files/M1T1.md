# Grade 6 — Percents: Read & Practice Pack

## What is a percent?

* **Percent** means “per $100$.” The symbol **\%** tells you the whole is $100$. So $45\%$ means $45$ out of $100$.
* A **hundredths grid** $(10\times 10)$ is a picture model for percents: $100\ \text{little squares} = 100\%$. Shade some squares to show the percent.

### Big idea

Percents, fractions, and decimals are just **different forms of the same number**. You can switch between them to compare, estimate, and solve problems.

---

## Benchmarks that make life easy

**Benchmark percents** are ones you use all the time: $1\%$, $5\%$, $10\%$, $25\%$, $50\%$, $100\%$. They help you estimate and also build any percent quickly (especially with $10\%\text{–}5\%\text{–}1\%$).

---

## Converting between fractions, decimals, and percents

* If a fraction’s denominator is a factor of $100$, scale it to $100$ to get the percent.\
  Example: $\left(\tfrac{4}{5}=\tfrac{80}{100}=80\%\right)$.
* If not, **divide** numerator ÷ denominator to get a decimal, then write it as a percent.\
  Example: $\left(\tfrac{5}{8}=0.625=62.5\%\right)$.

---

## Ordering fractions, decimals, and percents

First rewrite them all in the **same form** (all percents or all decimals), then compare.\
Example: order $\left(0.88\right)$, $\left(90\%\right)$, $\left(\tfrac{17}{20}\right)$. \
As percents: $88\%$, $90\%$, $85\%$ → **least→greatest:** $\left(\tfrac{17}{20},\ 0.88,\ 90\%\right)$.

---

## Strategies that always work

* **$10\%\text{–}5\%\text{–}1\%$ method:** :\
    Find $10\%$ (divide by $10$), \
    $5\%$ (half of $10\%$), and \
    $1\%$ (divide by $100$),\
     then **build** the percent you need.\
  *Example:* \
  $28\%$ of $500$:\
  $10\% = 50,$\
  $5\% = 25,$\
  $ 1\% = 5$\
  $\Rightarrow 28\% = 10\%+10\%+5\%+1\%+1\%+1\%$\
  $ = 50+50+25+5+5+5 = \boxed{140}.$
* **Double number line:** Line up the percent scale and the amount scale to find unknown parts or the whole.
* **Proportion method:** $\dfrac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}}=\dfrac{\text{percent}}{100}$. Solve for the missing value.

> **Common pitfall:** In picture models the **whole** isn’t always $100$.
> If $24$ of **$40$** squares are shaded, that’s $\tfrac{24}{40}=60\%$ (not $24\%$).\
Also, since more than half is shaded, it must be more than $50\%$.
