# Grade 6 Workbook — Positive Rational Numbers

(Topic 2: Fractions, Multiplying, Dividing, and Reciprocals)  


## Key Words (you should know these)

* **Unit fraction** – a fraction with a numerator of $1$, like $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{1}{3}$, $\frac{1}{12}$.
* **Equivalent fractions** – different-looking fractions that describe the same size, like $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{2}{4}$.
* **Benchmark fractions** – common “reference” fractions you compare to: $0$, $\frac{1}{2}$, and $1$.
* **Rational number** – any number you can write as $\frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are whole numbers and $b \neq 0$.
* **Algorithm** – a set of steps that will always work for a certain kind of math problem.
* **Reciprocal / Multiplicative inverse** – two numbers that multiply to $1$; for $\frac{a}{b}$ the reciprocal is $\frac{b}{a}$.
* **Complex fraction** – a fraction that has another fraction in the top, bottom, or both.
* **Ascending order** – smallest to largest.
* **Descending order** – largest to smallest.

## Section 1. Fractions, Unit Fractions, and Benchmark Fractions

### 1.1 What is a fraction?

A fraction shows “part of a whole.”  
The top number (numerator) tells how many parts you have.  
The bottom number (denominator) tells how many equal parts the whole is split into.

A **unit fraction** is a fraction where the numerator is $1$, like $\frac{1}{4}$ or $\frac{1}{12}$.  
These mean “one piece out of ___ equal pieces.”

### 1.2 Equivalent fractions

Two fractions are **equivalent** if they represent the same amount of the whole, even if they look different.  
Example: $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{2}{4}$ cover the same area of a bar model, so they’re equivalent.

### 1.3 Benchmark fractions

We can estimate or compare fractions by asking:

* Is it close to **$0$**? (numerator is tiny compared to denominator, like $\frac{1}{20}$)
* Is it close to **$\frac{1}{2}$**? (numerator is about half the denominator, like $\frac{3}{6}$ or $\frac{5}{10}$)
* Is it close to **$1$**? (numerator and denominator are almost the same, like $\frac{8}{9}$ or $\frac{11}{12}$)

These “$0,\ \frac{1}{2},\ 1$” fractions are called **benchmark fractions**.

### 1.4 Ordering fractions

* **Ascending order** means least $\rightarrow$ greatest.
* **Descending order** means greatest $\rightarrow$ least.

### 1.5 Rational numbers

A **rational number** is any number that can be written as $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are whole numbers and $b \neq 0$.  
Fractions are rational numbers.  
Mixed numbers and whole numbers are also rational numbers.

#### Quick Check (Section 1)

1. Which of these is a unit fraction?
   * $\frac{1}{5}$, $\frac{3}{5}$, $\frac{5}{5}$
2. Are $\frac{2}{4}$ and $\frac{1}{2}$ equivalent? Yes / No
3. Which benchmark is $\frac{3}{6}$ closest to: $0$, $\frac{1}{2}$, or $1$?
4. Put these in **ascending order** (least $\rightarrow$ greatest): $\frac{1}{3}$, $\frac{2}{3}$, $\frac{3}{3}$
5. Put these in **descending order** (greatest $\rightarrow$ least): $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{1}{4}$, $\frac{3}{8}$
6. Which is greater: $\frac{5}{6}$ or $\frac{4}{5}$?
7. Look at $\frac{1}{12}$. What is the denominator?
8. Which is smaller: $\frac{1}{12}$ or $\frac{1}{10}$?
9. Fill in the blanks:  
   A rational number can be written as $\_\_ / \_\_$ where the bottom is not $\_\_\_\_$.
10. Write a fraction that is close to $1$ (but not equal to $1$) with denominator $9$: $\_\_\_\_ / 9$

---

## Section 2. Multiplying Fractions

We can think of multiplying fractions as “part of a part.”

Example: $\frac{1}{4}$ of $\frac{1}{2}$ means “take half, then take one-fourth of that half.”  
An area model: one direction is cut into $4$ equal parts, the other into $2$ equal parts, and the overlap is the product.  
The overlap represents $\frac{1}{8}$ of the whole rectangle.  
This matches $\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8}$.

**Important idea:**  
To multiply two fractions, multiply straight across the numerators and straight across the denominators.

Multiply straight across:

[
$\frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d}$
]

becomes

[
$\frac{a \times c}{b \times d}$
]

Example:

[
$\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{5}{6}
= \frac{2 \times 5}{3 \times 6}
= \frac{10}{18}
= \frac{5}{9}$
]

The “multiply across” method is the standard **algorithm** for multiplying fractions.

#### Quick Check (Section 2)

1. Multiply and simplify: $\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} = \_\_\_\_$
2. Multiply and simplify: $\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{3}{5} = \_\_\_\_$
3. In your own words: what does the numerator in the product tell you?

---

## Section 3. Mixed Numbers and Multiplication

A **mixed number** is a whole number plus a fraction, like $2\frac{1}{2}$.

To multiply mixed numbers:
1. Turn each mixed number into an improper fraction.
2. Multiply across.
3. (Usually) turn back into a mixed number.

Example from your lesson:

[
$1\frac{3}{4} \times 2\frac{1}{2}
= \frac{7}{4} \times \frac{5}{2}
= \frac{35}{8}
= 4\frac{3}{8}$
]

This is exactly how you multiply two mixed numbers in word problems.

#### Quick Check (Section 3)

Solve and write your final answer as a mixed number if needed:

1. $1\frac{3}{4} \times 2\frac{1}{2} = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_$
2. $3 \times 1\frac{2}{3} = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_$
3. $4\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{2}{3} = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_$

---

## Section 4. Dividing with Fractions (Whole $\div$ Fraction)

Division asks “How many groups of ___ are in ___ ?”

Example:  
$6 \div \frac{1}{2}$ means “How many halves are in $6$?”  
Each whole can be cut into $2$ halves.  
So $6$ wholes have $12$ halves, so:

[
$6 \div \frac{1}{2} = 12$
]

This matches the visual model: each whole is split into halves, and you count how many halves total.

For something like $4 \div \frac{2}{3}$:

* First, break each whole into thirds. Now you have lots of $\frac{1}{3}$-size pieces.
* Then group those thirds in groups of size $\frac{2}{3}$.
* You end up with $6$ groups, so $4 \div \frac{2}{3} = 6$.

That “cut into denominator pieces, then group by the numerator” is what the strip/bar model is doing.

#### Quick Check (Section 4)

1. $6 \div \frac{1}{2} = \_\_\_\_$
2. $4 \div \frac{2}{3} = \_\_\_\_$
3. Explain: In $6 \div \frac{1}{2}$, why is the answer bigger than $6$, not smaller?

---

## Section 5. Division, Reciprocals, and Complex Fractions

Another way to divide by a fraction is to **multiply by its reciprocal** (also called multiplicative inverse).

* The reciprocal of $\frac{a}{b}$ is $\frac{b}{a}$, because

[
$\frac{a}{b} \times \frac{b}{a} = 1$
]

* So instead of doing “fraction $\div$ fraction,” we can do “fraction $\times$ reciprocal.”

This is true even in examples like $\frac{5}{8} \div \frac{15}{16}$, which you solve by turning division into multiplication by the reciprocal and then simplifying.

A **complex fraction** is a fraction where the top and/or bottom is itself a fraction.  
You can rewrite a division expression as a complex fraction and then use reciprocals to simplify it.

#### Quick Check (Section 5)

Rewrite each as multiplication and solve:

1. $\frac{5}{8} \div \frac{15}{16} = \_\_\_\_$
2. $\frac{2}{3} \div \frac{4}{5} = \_\_\_\_$
3. $\frac{7}{10} \div \frac{1}{2} = \_\_\_\_$
4. What is the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{4}$? $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_$
